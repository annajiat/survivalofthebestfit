				p This is a simplified simulation, but we hope it got you thinking. Now imagine how difficult it is to choose for a real-life recruiter! <br>

				p When there are many unknowns, people tend to rely on their gut feelings, which is just an expression of their biases and preconceptions. <br>
			
				p You might not be consciously discriminative, but in the early days of your company you received more highly qualified orange applicants. The unknowns and the biased environment can make well-intentioned decisions biased. This is what the industry needs to realize. <br>

				h3 Training the Biased Algorithm

				p When the engineering team contacted you, they asked you for <b>your</b> decisions, in <b>cv_all.zip</b> , because a machine learning (ML) algorithm requires human input. <br>

				img.center-block(src='assets/img/sotbf-training.gif')

				p That means if you had biases, the software would replicate them! But what if you were as objective as you could be? <br> 

				p Your data alone wasn't enough to build a ML algorithm, because machine learning works only on large amounts of data. That’s why the software engineer asked you to choose a larger dataset. The problem is, all datasets are built by humans who tend to be biased. <br>

				p In this case, it largely consisted of applicants from Orange Valley, where more people were historically allowed to work in tech. <br>

				h3 Behind the Difficulties

				p Can we disregard race or gender? <br>

				p There are no buttons on ML algorithms and the input data is often difficult to debias. While applicants don’t put race or gender explicitly on their CVs, they are often manifested through the colleges, communities, and organizations certain demographics are usually a part of. <br>

				img.center-block(src='assets/img/sotbf-automated.gif', style="width: 60%; margin-right: auto; clear: right; margin-top: 3%;")

				p When a program learns from years of data, we need to question the data it is learning from. Just because a decision is presented as 'automated' doesn't mean it is right or objective. <br>

				p Your startup Bestfit might've failed today, but there's no reason our societies should! Head to our website to learn more. We hope it'll make you discuss and ask questions. <br>
