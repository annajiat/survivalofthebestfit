				h4.header-box BEHIND THE TECH

				p.info-box You don't need to be an engineer to question the tech affecting our lives. The goal isn't necessarily to have everyone start building AI, though the field can certainly use <a style="text-decoration-line: underline; color:#BE5E5E" href='trial.html'> more diversity</a>, but to have enough awareness to join the conversation and ask important questions! <br> <br> <a style="text-decoration-line: underline; color:#BE5E5E" href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-EtmaFJieY'> Machine learning (ML)</a>, is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with teaching computers how to make decisions by learning from large amounts of data. This can be powerful and useful, but it just because a decisions is 'automated', doesn't mean it has to be correct, objective, or fair. <br> <br> When building automated decision-making systems, we should be asking: what metrics are these decisions based on, and who can we hold accountable? With machine learning, that becomes tricky, because after the program is trained on pre-existing data, finding out <b><i> why </i></b> a certain decision was made isn't straightforward. It's what is referred to as the <b> Black Box problem</b>. <br> <br> Technology should help us move forward, and not repeat the mistakes of the past. If the data we use, for example, is from a time when only people of a certain race, gender, or class are privileged by the system, then what are we teaching our software?

				h4.header-box BUILDING BETTER SOFTWARE

				p.info-box We want to make sure our technology works for everyone, and doesn't make historic injustices and inequalities <a style="text-decoration-line: underline; color:#BE5E5E" href="https://points.datasociety.net/systemic-algorithmic-harms-e00f99e72c42"> even more systemic</a>. Fairness is subjective, and bias is complicated. We don't expect software engineers to solve it all - which is why we think you should be a part of the conversation. <br> <br> Building software isn't a purely technical challenge when it involves many social, political, and economic implications. Whether it relates to algorithmic bias, or other ways tech is affecting our lives, we need to be able to ask questions, and hold developers accountable. Sometimes, we might have to ask, how did you ensure this software doesn't oppress or exclude? At other times, we ask, is using this technology suitable at all? If a machine learning solution doesn't allow us to question its outcome, should governments and corporations be able to use automated decision-making to absolve themselves from responsibility?

				h4.header-box TAKING STEPS FORWARD

				p.info-box <b> Education and Awareness </b> <br> <br> We believe that the first step to achieving real progress is to engage in research and conversation with groups and individuals both within and outside the technical field, such as policy-makers, lawyers, social scientists, and advocacy groups. We need to gain a better understanding of how to navigate fairness, bias, and equity in the digital world. For that to be possible, we must work on bridging the technical gap. We want issues in tech ethics to be accessible to those who may have not taken a computer science class before, but still have a lot to add to the conversation. <br> <br> <b> Ethical Frameworks </b> <br> <br> While we think people outside of tech should be involved, we want tech companies and software developers to make an effort too. This means making discussions about ethics be a conscious part of the software development process. <br><br> Institute for the Future and Omidyar Network worked on <a href='https://ethicalos.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Ethical-OS-Toolkit.pdf')>Ethical OS</a>, “a guide to anticipating the future impact of today’s technology”.  <br> <br> AI Now Institute, based at NYU, have also worked on an <a href='https://ainowinstitute.org/aiareport2018.pdf')> Algorithmic Impact Assessment </a> guide aimed at public agencies, with the aim of providing a practical framework to assess automated decision systems.
